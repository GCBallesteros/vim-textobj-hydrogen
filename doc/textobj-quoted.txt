INTRODUCTION					*textobj-hydrogen-introduction*

The *textobj-hydrogen* plugin provides two new |text-objects| which are
triggered by `ah` and `ih` respectively. You can use them when you have to
deal with hydrogen style notebook cells.  This are usually encountered when
transforming jupyter notebooks to plain text files with tools such as 
jupytext and notedown.

All code cells start with `# %%` . The end of the cell is implicitly defined
by either a new cell marker or the end of the file. The `ah` object includes
the marker line while the `ih` does not. Both commands treat the end of the
cell in the same way.
